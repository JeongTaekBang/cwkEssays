# Why Do You Invest? How Can You Be a Good, Rational, Wise Investor?

Have you ever asked yourself this simple question as an investor?

Why do you choose to invest? 

Since we're focusing on the stock market here, let's stick to that.

If you haven't thought about it at all, or if your answer is "to make money," you're missing the point. In fact, if you gave the latter answer, you're already in the wrong mindset, and I'm honestly worried about you.

There are countless ways to make money. You can start a business, work a job, or even gamble. But why do you choose to invest in the stock market, risking your hard-earned money?

I'll give you a minute to think about it. Please, take your time. I said, take your time. Don't just skim through this. Think about it.

Here's a hint: think mathematically.

Done? Good.

I said mathematically because investing is all about math. Of course, there's no right answer to this question. But from the broadest possible perspective, the answer is simple: to grow your wealth. And mathematically speaking, one of the worst ways to grow your wealth is through 'addition,' like adding your salary month by month.

See? You can already estimate how much you'd have in 10 years if you just saved your salary in a bank account. It's not that hard. If you experience a severe setback during that time, like a medical emergency, you'd be in deep trouble. All these scenarios are easy to calculate and predict. Why?

Again, answer this question. Why is it so easy to calculate and predict? Because...? Because...?

Please think on your own and answer it, goddammit. Without any effort to think, you won't improve at all.

Again, think about it and try to answer this question as best as you can. You already have your hint. It's mathematical.

Yes! You did it! It's so easy to calculate and predict since it's damn linear! Just a straight line with a given slope on a Cartesian plane, in other words, an X-Y graph.

Go ahead and chart this graph on two axes: X and Y. X is a timeline, and Y is your accumulated salary. You will have a straight line even if you get an annual raise over time.

Now, get back to the first question. Why do you invest? Or more accurately, why should you invest if you can be a good, rational, wise investor? The conditional part of this rephrased question is damn important since you're risking everything the moment you step into the market.

Why do you invest? I hope you answer this question mathematically and reasonably this time. We're talking about it in a mathematical context. It's not the perfect correct answer but given this context it should border on the correct side. Right?

Yes, that's it. The line becomes exponential. It's no longer a straight line. It's a curve that grows exponentially. That's why you invest. That's why you take the risk. That's why you're here.

Everybody knows this. But why do so many people fail at investing? Why do they lose money? Why do they give up? 

Because they never thought about it themselves. They never asked themselves this simple question and explained it to themselves. They never understood the math behind it. They never understood the risk they were taking. They never understood the reward they were seeking. And most importantly, they never understood themselves, the prerequisites like being a good, rational, wise investor.

Are you? Are you a good, rational, wise investor? Are you sure? Are you really sure?

What do you think is the first step to becoming a good, rational, wise investor? 

Again, there can't be one right answer to this question. But we may agree on something very fundamental here: be a mathematical thinker. Math is the language of the universe. You can't deny its clarity in any field. You can't deny its power in investing.

Remember why you shouldn't be using leverage in investing? Have you explained why to yourself?

The following math needs no further explanation.

-1 x 100000 = -100000

Minus one times 100000 equals minus 100000.

If you're a bad investor with continuous negative returns, you'll end up with nothing, even if you start with billions. See the power of math? You're essentially multiplying a large amount by a negative rate of return. Simply put, this means you're making poor decisions. Normally, you're not foolish or irrational, but the market can make you act that way. It can cause you to lose your focus and your money, turning you into its victim.

Clear thinking helps you avoid many deceptive allures of the market. Nothing can be clearer than simple math. It's the ultimate weapon against the market. It's the ultimate weapon against Sophon. It's the ultimate weapon against yourself under her spell. Don't just try to be a wallfacer. Become a true, rational, wise wallfacer.

That's why you need mathematically clear thinking. Because? Yes, since that's the clearest and simplest, not even you under the spell of the market can bend or distort it.  

You choose to invest in the stock market to enjoy the exponential growth of your wealth. If your return doesn't compound and just follow a linear path over time, you have little incentive to invest. Because? Yes, because you're not a fool. Accumulating your hard-earned money in the bank poses little risk, while investing in the stock market poses a great risk. You may end up penniless if you're not a good, rational, wise wallfacer.

Agree with this simple grand premise of investing? 

Good.

Let's move on to the next step.

Then how do you become a good, rational, wise wallfacer almost immune from the market's allure?

What's your ultimate weapon?

Do we have to go through this again? 

Yes! Math. Not complex math, but simple math, the simplest math you can think of. So simple that you just speak it out loud without much brain power. As simple as the above example. If you need a calculator, or even Excel-like spreadsheets, you're an even worse investor than those who don't even think about math. 

All those fancy tools just give you a false sense of security. They make you think you're a good, rational, wise investor just because you use those tools. "Yeah, I'm better than the rest of you, idiots!" kind of Chunibyo mentality. I'm 99% sure you know what I'm talking about. How? That's how we, stupid humans, are designed and evolved. I won't go into the concept of normal distribution here, but you get the idea. 

Oh, did I mention even statistical thinking should be as simple as what we're talking about here? If you see someone using Python or R for investing, they're just showing off. I can and I do sometimes to show you how some concepts work, but I never, again, NEVER, use these fancy tools for investing. I just use simple math, right off my noggin. If you can't, you are doing something seriously wrong. That's my honest opinion.

No more digressions. Let's get back to the point.

How do you become a good, rational, wise wallfacer almost immune from the market's allure?

The gist of this question is akin to the definition of growth.

You want a stock with great growth potential, right? Right? Then what's the definition of growth?

Goddamnit, what have you been thinking all this time if you can't define and explain anything to yourself? And you still think you can beat all those wallfacers out there in the market and be a winner? You're way off, man.

You don't want linear growth. You want exponential growth. Right? Now you know what I will be asking: what's exponential growth?

Growth that compounds. Linear growth means a series of additions. Exponential growth means every incremental addition in the series should also grow, the simple logic behind the compounding rate, right? Your principle grows and so do your interests. 

Now with these simple, so basic, fundamental concepts under your belt, you should be able to answer this question.

How do you become a good, rational, wise wallfacer almost immune from the market's allure?

Yes! A person with exponentially growing fundamentals! You learn something, you internalize it, make it a habit, and then you become a better person based on that strengthened fundamental. You accept other challenges and repeat the same virtuous cycles of exponential growth. You become a better person, a better investor, a better wallfacer.

Don't you feel that pump in your chest? That's the feeling of growth. That's the feeling of becoming a better person. That's the feeling of becoming a better investor. That's the feeling of becoming a better, true wallfacer.

But, hold your horses just yet. Let's not get too carried away.  

Let's be real. Let's be honest. Look at yourself and honestly answer this question.

Are you an exponentially growing person? Do you live such a life? Do you have such a mindset? Do you have such a habit? Do you have such a discipline? Do you have such a commitment? Do you have such a track record?

Do you think mathematically? Do you think statistically? Do you think logically? Do you explain everything to yourself out loud? Can you go on and on explaining things, anything, to people when necessary? Do they get so convinced by you that they pull out their phones to check stock prices? You get the idea.

Can you honestly say yes to all these simple, obvious, fundamental questions?

If not, you won't be a good, rational, wise wallfacer, no matter what you do. Even if you spend all spare time every day on something you think is necessary to become a better one, you're just doing it with a linear mindset. 

No, I'm not saying that linear mindset is bad. It's just not enough in this day and age, especially in the cruel, merciless stock market.

Don't forget. You're competing with all those wallfacers out there. Someone like me. Someone who's been doing this for decades or someone born with the gift. You're competing with them.

Here's another math nugget for you: only a fraction of market participants are winners. The rest are losers. You know what that means, right?

If you stifle your growth potential with a linear mindset or, even worse, by doing nothing, you're effectively choosing to be a loser.

The point of exerting smart effort is all based on this simple concept of exponential growth.

Expanding horizons is all about exponential growth. One horizon contributes to another, and another, and another. Every step is like interest to your principal. They compound. They grow together, contributing to your overall growth. Damn, Eureka! Right?

Yes, that's the whole point of object-oriented thinking. The four pillars of object-orientation again? Abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

Abstract everything.

You accept a challenge, inheriting from your previous strengthened fundamental or a previous horizon.

You polymorph that challenge for easy digestion and internalization. Simply put, it means only the additional portion of the challenge is new. The rest is just a repetition of what you've done before.

You clarify what's important and encapsulate what’s not or what can wait for later digestion in your mind.

How simple is that? How powerful is that? How clear is that?

The question is, can you do it? Would you do it?

Or, should I say, WILL you do it?

Let me give you a nudge.

Damn, I always do.
