# Turning Around Bad Habits, Bad Reputation, and Bad Returns - Lessons from the First Descendant

If I ask you, "What's your return on investment in the stock market?" or any financial investment for that matter, you'd probably have a number or percentage to show.

Just humor this idea and answer this question: "What's your annual return?"

Chances are, unless you're a savvy long-term investor, you'd probably want to cherry-pick a nice sample from all your good years, right?

But if an investor hits a 10-bagger in one year and loses 90% the next year, what's the average return?

If they repeat this cycle for 10 years, what's the average return?

The answer would be, astonishingly, 0% or less. Why less? If they go the leverage route, they'd be in debt.

This should remind you of someone very famous in the financial world: Jesse Livermore. Some still consider and try his trading strategies, only to go bust in the end, just like he did. They think they could do better and stop right before going bust. They just don't want to see his tragic end: taking his own life in a hotel room, alone.

Here's some food for thought in terms of this lesson:

- What if a criminal with years of bad reputation suddenly turns around and claims he's become a saint? Would you trust him?
- What if a company with years of bad reputation suddenly claims they've changed and are now the best in the industry? Would you invest in them?

The second example is deliberate since we're seeing something like this happening again. We'll see if they can turn around their bad reputation and bad habits: Nexon, the developer of the currently hot looter shooter, "The First Descendant."

As a fellow Korean, I was both proud and embarrassed when the game was hot on the global scene while getting review-bombed. The reason for my pride needs little explanation, but why embarrassed? Almost all the players think badly of Nexon due to their 'shady' practices in the past. Yes, notable reviewers did use this term, 'shady,' describing Nexon: pay-to-win, loot boxes, gacha, drop-rate manipulation, and so on. I didn't even realize they were this bad until I saw the reviews. I just thought they were a bit greedy, but not to this extent.

Amusingly, they claim they've changed, been born again, almost saying, "Trust us. This time it's different."

Really? Even if they prove their sincerity with the First Descendant, would you trust them? Would you invest in them?

The answer should be no because it's just one data point. They've got to prove themselves over time that they can turn the downward spiral around. That downward spiral of bad reputation and bad habits is a very steep one that has been going on for years.

It's simple arithmetic: to turn around a 10-year downward spiral, you need at least 10 years of good reputation and good habits just to break even.

However, they can turn around faster if they're sincere and consistent. Why? It's not simple arithmetic we're talking about here.

Thanks to human psychology, we tend to remember most recent events more vividly than past events. We even have terms for that: recency bias and availability heuristic.

That is, even if you have 10 years of bad returns, you may get away with three to four years of recent good returns. The higher the returns, the better. That's the gist of the idea.

The concept of moving averages in stock trading is similar. You can't just look at the most recent data point. You've got to look at the moving averages to see the trend. The trend is the keyword here, and we usually focus more on the recent trend than the past trend. What an opportunity for Nexon to turn all those negatives around, right? Just a couple more good games while doing nothing shady, and they're good to go. We will all forgive and forget. Would they do that, however? That we shall see.

It's science. Statistically speaking, moving averages are created by giving more weight to the recent group of data points than the past ones. For instance, a 5-day moving average gives more weight to the last 5 days than the past 5 days. A 10-day moving average gives more weight to the last 10 days than the past 10 days. And so on. That is, you draw the curve of the moving average by first averaging the data points of the given period to produce a single data point on the curve, then continue to do so for the rest of the data points and just connect the dots. What it implies is that every dot on the curve is a weighted average of the data points in the given period. You can't average up the whole dot just by increasing a single data point in the group! That's the beauty of moving averages and their implications.

Look at the example of 5-day moving average data points over a one-year period. If your moving average looks like that, it's hopeless since it shows little upward trend. It's just a bunch of hit-or-misses, basically gambling. You need to have more good days to increase the moving average.

Seasoned investors don't look at short-term moving averages, and you shouldn't either.

Take 10-year annual moving averages for example. Every dot on the curve is an average of the past 10 years on the given point! You need to have 10 years of good returns to increase that point even just a bit on the curve. That's the power of moving averages.

And you still yell at people, "Trust me! This time it's different!" Really? You only had a year of good returns, for crying out loud! And in a historic bull market, no less! What about those 10 years of bad returns resulting from your shady practices and bad habits?

People around you are natural statisticians. They don't need to know the math behind it. They just know whether you've changed or not. To earn their trust, you need to crank up those moving averages of trust in their minds. The same principle applies to anything with time series data.

Now you can explain why bad reputation and bad habits die hard.

Again, the most crucial is the recent trend of your moving average, which means you can always start over. You can always turn around. You can always redeem yourself. Don't give up. Just keep at it. 

And now you know why I don't trust most of you claiming you've changed in terms of long-term vision investing. You have yet to prove yourself over time. Don't yell at us that you've changed just because you've got a year of good returns or mended bad habits. We will know when you really have changed. We're watching your moving averages over time. They change very slowly, but they do change. The slopes of those moving averages either stay flat, go up, or go down. We're watching. Just prove it over time. That's all.

Amusingly enough, like I've mentioned in my previous posts, even your inner self needs that proof.

It must have been "Terra," an MMORPG my wife and I once enjoyed. In it, an NPC randomly quips: "좋은 것은 오래 걸리는 법입니다" or something along that line. "Good things take time" in English. Mostly when players impatiently click on him for something to happen.

Yeah, a cheesy line, but it's true. Good things take time. My wife and I still joke about it when we're impatient about something.

Good things take time. Don't forget that. If you're really on the path to redemption, it's a good thing, and it will take time. That's a good thing too.

Finally, carve this keyword in your brain like a legendary rune or something: sustainability. It's just another way of looking at what we've discussed so far. How sustainable are your good returns? How sustainable is your good reputation? How sustainable are your good habits? How sustainable is your redemption?

Interesting, isn't it? Sustainability is a concept based on time series data. Yeah, good things do take time.

If you stop working out after a three-month streak, that fatally attractive ass you got there? That's unsustainable. That's the idea.
