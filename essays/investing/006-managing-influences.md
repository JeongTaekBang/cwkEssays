# The Zero That Always Finds You

![](images/006-1.png)

I have a firm rule: I mute accounts that could negatively influence myself and my followers.

With the way X's algorithm operates, certain influencers inevitably pop up on your feed, shaping perspectives in subtle, often unnoticed ways. What might seem harmless at first glance can accumulate over time, gradually shifting how you think. When exposed repeatedly to certain types of content, it can slowly alter your decisions and actions in ways that may ultimately be harmful.

I’m particularly cautious of those who openly flaunt risky leveraged positions. Regardless of their intentions, promoting this behavior can be deeply damaging. The irony—and the tragedy—is that these same individuals may one day face the dire consequences of their own recklessness. The fallout often extends beyond just them, impacting their families and loved ones as well.

You might think, "It's just a small percentage, what's the harm?" But this mindset is precisely what makes it dangerous. Like many addictive behaviors, it often starts innocuously before spiraling into serious problems. The human mind is remarkably susceptible to subtle influences—what seems like minor exposure can gradually reshape our decision-making patterns in ways we don't consciously recognize.

It's all a matter of probability, a simple law that can’t be overlooked. Even if you’re right 90% of the time, that leaves a 10% margin for failure. Eventually, that zero shows up: 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 ... x n x 0 = 0. You will encounter that one fatal mistake, and when it hits, it wipes everything out.

It's foolish to ignore this. Those who boast about their leverage often walk a dangerous path, much like Jesse Livermore, the famous trader who, despite amassing a fortune multiple times, lost it all and ended up taking his own life in a hotel room. His tragic end proves that no amount of trading success can protect you from the devastating psychological toll of extreme risk-taking.

This isn’t a matter of *if* but *when*. The probability, cold and unforgiving, makes this outcome almost certain for those who push their luck too far.

Consider it like this: if your leveraged position faces consequences early, it's a sign that God is watching over you with tough love. If not, you're either being set up for a harsher divine lesson, or you've already wandered into the devil's playground.

I have a zero-tolerance policy for those who, knowingly or unknowingly, promote risky leveraged trading. Their reckless behavior and boastful displays aren't just annoying—they can have devastating real-world consequences. When someone's misguided confidence leads others down a dangerous financial path, the damage can be irreparable. This isn't hyperbole; it's a harsh reality I've witnessed too many times.

If you're unknowingly promoting risky trading behavior, consider why we restrict depictions of smoking, drinking, and drug use in media—these portrayals have proven psychological impacts on viewers. The same principle applies here: your actions influence others, whether you intend to or not.

If I see you in person, I might smack you in the head about your Chunibyo-like delusions of grandeur.
