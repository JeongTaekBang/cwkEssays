# The Enduring Power of Plans and Principles

One of the most common and elusive pitfalls in following plans and principles is the tendency to doubt them based on a single outcome.

We often make the mistake of adjusting our plans and principles to fit individual results. But if our principles are fundamentally sound, they shouldn't need constant adjustment. While they may not guarantee success in every situation, solid principles remain valid even when individual outcomes disappoint.

History offers us stark examples. Consider how monarchs, in their short-sightedness, nearly executed generals for battlefield setbacks, only to have those same strategies vindicated over the course of entire campaigns. The generals understood what their rulers did not: that strategy plays out over time, not in isolated moments.

Consider Admiral Yi Sun-sin's treatment by King Seonjo of Korea. Despite being one of history's most brilliant naval commanders, Yi was stripped of his rank, imprisoned, and tortured based on false accusations. Yet when Japan launched its invasion, Korea desperately reinstated him, and his unwavering principles and strategies proved decisive in saving the nation. The irony is striking: while his king, fellow generals, and even his subordinates doubted him, Yi stayed true to his principles and strategic vision. His vindication came not through compromise or abandoning his methods, but through steadfast adherence to what he knew to be correct.

As Sun Tzu famously observed, while war is fundamentally about deception, even the cleverest deception only works reliably once. This speaks to a deeper truth about strategy: the power lies not in isolated tactical victories, but in the steady application of sound principles over time. Just as a general must maintain their strategic vision through the fog of war, we too must hold fast to our principles through life's constant battles of perception and deception. Life itself is perhaps the greatest theater of strategy, where consistent adherence to well-reasoned principles ultimately prevails over momentary tactical advantages.

The goal isn't perfect certainty, but rather optimizing for the highest probability of success. A world where every outcome aligns with our plans would be unnaturally predictable. Even the gods, it seems, prefer a degree of uncertainty.

Success should be measured by our consistent execution of sound principles, not by any single result. Positive outcomes accumulate through the repeated application of good practices. When we abandon our principles at the first sign of difficulty, we surrender control to pure chance rather than reasoned strategy.

Consider what distinguishes us as rational beings: our capacity for principled thinking and planning. This is what sets us apart.

Yet many either lack guiding principles entirely or fail to maintain them when tested. This inability to stay the course often leads to long-term failure.

The irony is clear: why establish principles at all if we won't follow them through both success and setback?

I have been fortunate to face immediate consequences for any deviation from my plans and principles. Luck never allowed me to stray without repercussions. Each deviation was met with a lesson, reinforcing the importance of staying true to my path. For that, I am deeply grateful.

If you find yourself escaping the consequences of your deviations, consider whether you're truly being guided by a higher purpose, creator, or even by your own sense of discipline. Without facing challenges and learning from them, one risks being shielded from growth rather than nurtured for it.
