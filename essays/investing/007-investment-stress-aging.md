# Dealing with Market Stress: You Won't Be Young and Aggressive Forever

I'll be direct to avoid any confusion or false expectations—I'm not here to call any market bottoms or tops. I'm simply sharing my perspective: weighing scenarios with educated, rational confidence. That's all.

Admittedly, there was a time when I went all in or all out, embracing an aggressive investment strategy. Sometimes it worked wonders, propelling my portfolio to new heights. Other times, it failed spectacularly, leaving me on the brink. That strategy can be a rollercoaster—thrilling when it pays off, but unforgiving when it doesn't. It's just a matter of time before the risk catches up to you.

As you age and your portfolio grows, you become more cautious. It's inevitable. Trust me, especially for the young ones reading this: you won't always be able to sustain the relentless ups and downs of an all-or-nothing approach. There comes a point when even a physically fit body can't sleep, exhausted from the mental toll of constantly going all in or out.

The truth is, we all need to find our own golden ratio—a balance between being invested and protecting our peace of mind. It's that balance that allows you at least a minimum good night's sleep. Aging makes it harder to handle the stress of aggressive investing, both physically and mentally. It's not a question of if, but when.

Fatigue, whether physical or emotional, affects not just you but everyone around you. It's easy to vent that stress onto loved ones, even if your investments are doing well. Your body—seeking survival—reacts to stress in ways that are hard to control, and that has consequences.

You'll know it's time to change when the market stops making you feel happy—whether you're fully in or completely out. For me, I've declared retirement from the market more than once. Right now, I'm out for myself, but still in for my wife—I can't let her endure the same turmoil. Age takes its toll, and none of us can predict just how severe it will be. We're all different, shaped by unique circumstances and genetics.

Having billions in your portfolio doesn't make you immune to the impact of being in the market too long. The market is like Hotel California: you think you can check out anytime, but you can never leave. I tried checking out multiple times, yet here I am, still dealing with it. The best I can do is manage my ratio—how much of me is stressed by it.

Bear or bull markets—neither guarantees peace. The only real strategy is to manage. When you're at the frayed ends of sanity, you do foolish things. And believe me, that's exactly what the market wants: it wants you to lose your mind.

Don't get me wrong. Losing sanity doesn't just come from fear; it can come from elation or even from being completely out of the market. The fear of losing gains or missing out always lingers. You can't leave. Remember?

History repeats itself—both good and bad. This isn't just about predicting disasters; it's about understanding that, once in, you're in for life. Unless, of course, you lose everything and are forced out. But assuming you remain, it's a lifelong relationship.

Depending on your positions and expectations, you may interpret this differently—and that's entirely your own problem to solve. For me, I've never been fully out. It's just about how much I'm in. The sustainable solution I've found is simply to weigh scenarios with educated, rational confidence. That way, I can at least manage a decent night's sleep.

To fight the fear, anxiety, and hubris the market stirs up, I draw. I play games. I walk with my wife. I watch movies. These activities are my anchor—my way to escape the grasp of the market.

Anyone who says they're completely at ease with the market is either lying or doesn't know enough yet—maybe they're too young or haven't seen what the market can really do.

So, how do I view the market today? Like I said before—I'm not entirely in, nor entirely out. I'm just weighing scenarios with educated, rational confidence. No bottoms, no tops, no nothing.

How you see the market is your own journey—just make sure you manage the stress along the way.
