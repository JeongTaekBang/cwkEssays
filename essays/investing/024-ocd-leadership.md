# Why We Need OCD Assholes in Leadership

We often don't pay enough attention to the role of a strong leader in a company's success. This might be because such leaders can sometimes come off as, well, dictatorial. But the reality is, a strong leader is crucial for a company's triumph. A strong leader is someone who can make difficult decisions, inspire, and motivate their team toward a shared vision. They're capable of elevating the company to new heights and fostering growth. Importantly, a strong leader oversees almost every innovation from start to finish. Even when delegating tasks, they rarely completely hand over control. Instead, they remain a guiding and mentoring presence, thoroughly knowledgeable in every aspect of their domain.

Honestly, from my perspective, being perpetually nice and kind to everyone doesn't cut it for leadership material.

For further reading on this topic, I suggest two distinct books:

- "The Dictator's Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics" by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith
- "The Fourth K" by Mario Puzo

The former is an insightful non-fiction work, while the latter is a novel by Mario Puzo, famed for "The Godfather." I particularly recommend "The Fourth K." It brilliantly argues that a squeaky-clean leader isn't always the best choice, especially in the murky waters of politics.

I'm not one for political debates either, yet I can't help but see the parallels in business. Indeed, a strong leader must sometimes embrace being disliked for the greater good.

Consider the so-called OCD genius founders of innovative companies, often branded as difficult or even "assholes," who have ultimately emerged as exemplary leaders. Their approach may involve shouting, rudeness, and imposing seemingly impossible standards, but it's precisely this relentless drive that propels their teams and companies to remarkable achievements. They establish high expectations that become the company's new benchmarks. In contrast, overly accommodating leaders tend to lower the bar in a misguided attempt to please everyone, or even worse, set no expectations at all.

The saga of the Three Kingdoms in ancient China offers a vivid illustration. The three paramount leaders of this period were magnets for talent, attracting highly capable individuals who, under any other circumstances, might have led their own factions. Yet, it was the formidable presence of these leaders that unified such diverse talents towards achieving the extraordinary. Once these leaders passed away, the absence of their unifying strength led to fragmentation and decline, as seen in the aftermath of the deaths of Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Sun Quan. Without a strong leader to enforce a hierarchy and vision, an organization is prone to disintegration due to internal conflicts.

Interestingly, this dynamic is not unique to legitimate businesses; it's also seen in the underworld of organized crime. The decline of the Mob in the United States is often linked to the lack of a formidable leader who could enforce order and discipline. The Mafia's downfall started when the FBI effectively broke up its leadership hierarchy, which led to internal conflicts and disarray. Carlos Gambino, recognized as the last of the great Mafia dons, ruled with an iron fist. Despite being virtually invisible to the public eye for years, his influence permeated the entire organization and beyond. He held the title of "il capo di tutti capi," or the boss of all bosses, exerting supreme authority over New York's five families of La Cosa Nostra, which means "the Thing of Ours." His death marked the beginning of the Mafia's disintegration, as numerous capos competed for dominance. The case of John Gotti, who boldly eliminated his boss, Paul Castellano, in a stark bid for power, exemplifies this. Such a move would have been inconceivable without the tacit approval of other families, which indicates that Castellano's leadership was unsatisfactory to them. But let's not get too caught up in Mafia history, as fascinating as it may be. Let's move on.

The Mafia's downturn was hastened by the lack of a commanding leader to ensure discipline and order. Intriguingly, Vito Corleone, a character well-known from "The Godfather" movie, drew inspiration from Carlos Gambino. Gambino is viewed by some as a magnified Marcus Aurelius within the criminal world. However, that story is for another occasion.

It's interesting to note that this principle isn't exclusive to humans but extends throughout the animal kingdom. After all, humans are animals too. In all social animal groups, the leader is invariably the strongest, most dominant, and most assertive member. This pattern is observed in wolves, lions, and even ants. The leader is the decision-maker who secures the group's survival. The same logic applies to humans. The desire for pleasant company shouldn't lead us to expect an organization to flourish under the leadership of those who are merely nice. Reality simply doesn't operate like that.

Although the idea of disproportionate power is frequently seen in a negative light, it can be essential for sustaining order and driving an organization forward with clear vision and intent. Only a handful of leaders have the capability to wield such power effectively.

Consider the situation with those tech-dinosaur companies struggling to keep pace with innovation. They're often helmed by leaders who are overly accommodating, excessively pleasant, and too fearful of making hard choices. These are the leaders who dread the thought of being disliked, of being labeled as difficult, dictatorial, obsessive, or receiving any critique that might come across as negative.

In fact, it's rare to hear anyone refer to them as "assholes". They're simply described as "nice" and "kind."

Seriously?

From an investment standpoint, I'd much prefer an "asshole" at the helm, even if that means they're not universally liked. This approach has proven lucrative for me in the past and I expect it to continue doing so.

Historically and statistically, companies led by these so-called "asshole" leaders tend to outperform those with nicer leadership. That's not just opinion; it's a verifiable trend.

You're not on the lookout for a romantic partner; you're searching for a leader with the resilience to navigate a company through ups and downs toward success. This isn't about popularity; it's about efficacy.

One additional insight worth mentioning is that only those individuals capable of enduring the demands of a strong leader's expectations tend to stay within the company. Often, the extent of these leaders' demanding nature becomes publicly acknowledged only after employees depart the organization. This situation speaks volumes about both the leader's resilience and the company's culture. Those who find the environment too challenging and opt to leave are frequently those unable to match the company's dynamic pace. Consider the reasons behind their departure, especially after a strong leader exits the scene. Such leaders have the capacity to propel these talents to greater heights, and it's the company's culture that retains them. This underscores the necessity for more formidable leaders at the forefront.

Indeed, we need more "assholes" in charge.

Setting aside the endowment effect and post-purchase rationalization, consider the companies you're eyeing from a new angle. You might find the perspective revealing.

Imagine these companies as if they were kingdoms in ancient China. Ask yourself: At what stage are they? Are they flourishing under the guidance of a strong leader, or are they teetering on the edge of disintegration? Is there an ongoing power struggle, or are they already in a state of decline?

Pondering these questions can serve as a fascinating thought experiment. It might even prompt you to reevaluate your investment decisions.
