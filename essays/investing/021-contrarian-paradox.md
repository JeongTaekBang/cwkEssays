# The Contrarian Paradox

![](images/021-1.png)

Being a contrarian isn't just about being different; it's about thoughtfully choosing a path less traveled because you see something that others don't. It's simple: if the majority goes one way (95%), being contrarian means being among the few (5%) who dare to go in the opposite direction.

Yet, striving to stand completely apart from all human tendencies (aiming for that elusive 0.00...1%) ventures into the realm of the non-human, a goal that's beyond reach. Our actions, however unique they might seem, are part of the broader tapestry of human behavior. They are predictable to a degree by the very nature of our shared humanity and even more so by AI, which is trained on vast datasets of human decisions.

The beauty of being contrarian, then, does not lie in a complete departure from human nature but in the discernment to see where the majority may miss the mark and the courage to pursue that insight, even when it places you in the minority.

This pursuit is not vague or directionless; it's driven by a clear aim to add value or insight where it's overlooked, with an understanding that true distinction comes from clarity, purpose, and simplicity.

The first step to being contrarian, therefore, is to identify the threshold that distinguishes the majority from the minority and to be sure that the minority has a clear advantage.

Merely trying to be a vague contrarian is akin to floating a boat without a rudder.

Unfortunately, such an endeavor falls outside human capacity, hence the paradox.

Claiming to be contrarian might just be an expression of your own hubris.
