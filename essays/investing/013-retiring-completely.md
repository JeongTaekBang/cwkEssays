# Why and How I'm Retiring Completely, Again

A couple of days ago, I announced to my wife that I wanted to retire, again, this time completely.

You might be wondering why, since I am already retired. Well, I've always acted as the financial manager for my family. My only client? My wife. Many of you would know this already.

Yes, I have now retired from that role as well.

In this essay, I might mention some stocks and strategies I previously invested in, but I won't delve into specifics. These are all things of the past and likely not relevant to you now. Just a heads-up, as everyone's journey is different.

In 2011, I created an Investment Policy Statement (IPS) for my wife, which served as a 10-year financial plan for our family. Since we don’t have children, managing our finances was relatively straightforward. To develop this IPS, I undertook nine financial exams, both Korean and American, starting in 2008 and spanning about three years. I passed all except for the last one, the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) Level III. I remain a Level III candidate and have no plans to continue with it.

The primary goal was to professionally craft an IPS for my family, which I successfully accomplished. Although we slightly deviated from the plan, as often happens, we mostly remained on track.

In the meantime, I've been broadening my horizons by learning everything that comes my way. 

By 2021, coincidentally a decade after the creation of the IPS, we saw a return of about 1000% on our investments, a result of a seven-year long-term vision. Interestingly, I managed a small portfolio that mirrored my wife's, serving as a point man to navigate and test the strategies I employ while taking risks, although hers was significantly larger. My portfolio yielded a return of less than 1000%, but my wife did not intervene with her investments at all. She simply allowed them to grow and enjoyed a 1300% return on her investment. On average, we achieved a ten-bagger on our investments.

Since then, we haven't missed a year of paying taxes, which speaks volumes. Even this year, we paid a substantial amount in taxes, a positive indicator that we're still making money and enjoying the fruits by cashing out some of our investments. We've also been able to fully enjoy life, as I've detailed in my previous essays.

Firstly, I started with a mix of FAANG stocks and then went all in on Tesla, at a time when most people thought it was going under. I didn't believe it would, so I went all in. I was right. My method was simple: I just counted the number of cars and the ratio of EVs to ICEs on the road.

As Tesla continued to hit new highs, I decided to cash some out to contribute to our family's happiness. In 2021 and 2022, I bought and remodeled our house. It now includes a fully equipped music studio, home gym, three gaming stations, and various working environments. I couldn't ask for more, unless I got greedier for some reason. My wife still works as a professor at a graduate school and earns a handsome salary. She has no risk of getting sacked unless she decides to leave herself.

In other words, I achieved financial independence a long time ago and have since given some gains back to the market, but still have plenty left. When I ventured into the world of AI, I rebalanced our portfolios—my wife's remains significantly larger—reflecting the changing world. Microsoft was our cash equivalent, while Meta and Nvidia were our growth AI plays. This strategy was evident even in my GitHub AI repository. I created stock selection AI models for others to use and experiment with. The stock picker I developed, trained with real-world data, recommended Nvidia as the only growth stock meeting nearly all the criteria I set.

To cut a long story short, we regained lost ground with Meta and Nvidia. When Microsoft surpassed Apple as the most valuable company in the world, reaching a $3 trillion market cap, I decided to sell our Microsoft shares and increase our investments in Meta and Nvidia. This strategy was sensible and effective. As I mentioned in my last essay, I don't worry about cost basis or the plus-minus signs on my portfolio. I execute at the speed of light if I believe it's the right path. My wife simply follows my lead. Even if I make a mistake, she doesn't worry because she knows my track record. She has followed my strategies for over a decade and understands her position. This is how I eliminate human elements from my investment decisions, as I've discussed in my recent essays.

As Nvidia has emerged as a key player approaching the $3 trillion market cap territory, I've rebalanced my portfolio again. I currently don't own a single share of Nvidia, not because I believe it lacks a future, but due to the principle of large numbers. The growth from $2 trillion to $3 trillion represents just about a 50% return, and while significant, flag bearer candidates could potentially outperform that. Consider Microsoft’s history; after reaching its milestone, it stagnated for a while, allowing other flag bearers and candidates like Meta and Nvidia to catch up. That's when I increased my investments in them.

I believe history tends to repeat itself. This is my logical and object-oriented approach to investing.

I don't delude myself with the flawed logic of safer bets in the market. No, there are no safer bets, as human elements can always reduce your portfolio to zero. Given the risk of losing everything, you should aim for the highest reasonable return possible. That's the only way to survive in the market over the long term. The cycle involves gaining, losing some, and consolidating—not continually gaining and advancing without any setbacks. Believing in unending progress without losses is a recipe for mental disaster. I've seen many fall into this trap, and I've consistently warned against it. Always prepare for significant losses, even when you're currently winning. 

Just remember this: low beta stocks, or even bonds for that matter, mean little when you are your own worst enemy. 

I'm not disclosing my current holdings to avoid influencing others who might blindly follow, risking their financial stability, as has happened in the past. Simply copying someone else's portfolio doesn't ensure the same returns. Understanding the rationale behind investment decisions is crucial, and most people struggle with this aspect. I've always shared my thought process and how I manage through various market conditions, but too often, people overlook the strategy and focus on imitation, which can lead to significant losses. I want to avoid contributing to such outcomes. You can't guarantee that the same strategy will work for you, given your unique circumstances, risk tolerance, and horizons. The last word—horizons—I can't emphasize this enough, but most of you just don't get it.

Regarding AI investments, considering my actions over the past year, I believe I've rightfully earned my returns. This is what I mean by "earning your right" to money. Money tends to gravitate towards those who show they can handle it well. I consider myself merely a conduit in this process. If you've earned the right, you know it. If not, you might always be left wondering. Consider who should be more successful: someone who has invested time and effort into understanding AI, even going so far as to create his own models and write his online books on AI and Math, or someone who merely copies others’ investments?

I wrote another Investment Policy Statement for my wife the day I announced my retirement. This time, I didn’t even use Excel; I performed all necessary calculations in my head or using simple napkin math functions in OneNote. It was straightforward—a new 10-year plan based on clear logic and foresight. We've identified a couple of flag bearer candidates aiming for $2 trillion and $3 trillion market cap territories. If successful, we're set for another fruitful period of investment.

Why retire then? Honestly, I don't need more money to feel happy. Materially, I've been content since my first major investment success. I have everything I need and want, plenty of time to spend with my wife, and no children to worry about. The only real stress in my life comes from the market. The math is simple: remove that stress, and I'll be happier. However, I know I can check out anytime I like but can never really leave, so I've devised a mental strategy to reduce the stress.

Numerically, we don't even need another IPS, but that assumes I'm always there, doing the calculations. My wife, brilliant in many areas, isn't trained in market strategies. The first IPS was simple enough for her to understand, and she didn’t even have to do anything on her own. She just followed my lead. The second one is even simpler, ensuring that even in my absence, she can manage our finances. I've clearly outlined what she should focus on and what she can disregard. When the second IPS expires, it'll be her decision to continue investing or cash out and enjoy life. The market isn't worth the stress, I assured her.

I feel ready now, but she needs more time and experience to feel the same.

Back when I created the first IPS, I was eager to retire once it was fulfilled. I should have. I only added stress by not doing so. Financially, we're about the same, thanks to my adherence to core market principles and ignoring deceptive figures in my portfolio. I still make decisions at light speed, giving no leeway to Sophon, the ever-deceptive market. That's my edge. I can't expect the same from everyone. My advice? Leave the market entirely if you can. But then again, who am I kidding?

Nothing will change significantly; just my mindset. The market no longer plays a role in my life, though I might comment on it occasionally for fun. Now, I manage my life, not portfolios.

Here's the catch—the reason I couldn't fully retire the first time. If you're a serious gamer, you'd understand. Imagine being deeply involved in a game like the Soulsborne series, where you've spent hundreds of hours exploring, learning, and even creating related content, as I did with Bloodborne. Eventually, you reach a point where the game no longer excites you. You feel an emptiness and realize it's time to move on. That's how I felt when I first retired. So, I returned to the game, a game I didn't even enjoy.

We have to let go, even in life. There will come a day we must let go.

For those few who followed my path, anticipate this level of complexity in your life. You are not an AI; you must consider your human elements.

It might take a while until I can truly detach from the market, and perhaps I never will fully. But I have to try. I have to let go and move on.

If catastrophic crises occur, it’s my duty to protect my wife. So, I might come back, though I hope not.

In this tough journey, set markers and plant your battle flags—one at a time, do something you can be proud of. That's the only way to live meaningfully in this challenging game. And remember, the game never ends. You need to know when to stop playing, even if tempting rewards dangle before you.

You gain, expecting to lose. I've gained enough to be content. That's good enough.

Aim for that—not for everything, but for a good enough checkpoint and a good enough life.

When you check out, make sure you do so with a decent checkpoint in place, just like any sound AI model or wise human would.

Good luck.
