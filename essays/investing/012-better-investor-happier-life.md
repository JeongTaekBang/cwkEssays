# An Easy Way to Become a 10x Better Investor and Be Happier in Life

Here's a practical tip to become a 10x or even better investor. All you have to do is promise yourself to practice it and commit to it. It's that simple.

Promising is one thing, but committing is another. Remember that. If you commit to something, you have to do it. No excuses. No procrastination. No laziness. Just do it. If you promise yourself and commit but don’t follow through, you're just lying to yourself, and you won’t improve as an investor or even as a person. Think about it for a second. Don’t become such a loser. You’re better than that.

The promise part is so easy that you’ll find it amusing and rewarding: seek something you can immerse yourself in during your spare time and promise yourself to do it. That's it. But keep in mind the following conditions:

1. It should be something solely for you, something that makes you happy and makes you lose track of time.

2. This is all about you. Don’t think about your loved ones or friends. This is your time. If your spouse blames you for being selfish, tell them you're doing it for them. You're becoming a better person and a better investor for them. They should understand. If not, well, something’s off with your relationship. Mend it first.

3. Find something that seems remotely related to your interests. Something you haven’t seriously imagined doing but are curious about. It could be anything. Just make sure it’s not something you’re already good at. You won’t improve by doing something you’re already good at. It should be something you learn and get good at. You should feel rewarded by doing it anytime. Like drawing. Don’t ask, “Why should I pick up drawing?” Just do it. Don’t prejudge whether you’ll like it or not. Give it enough time to see if you like it. If you don’t, move on to the next thing. But don’t give up too early. Good things take time.

4. Don’t think about the money. You’re not doing it for money. You’re doing it for yourself, for your happiness. A happy spouse makes a happy house. A happy investor makes a happy portfolio. It’s that simple. You will be reborn as a happier person. And be honest, that money you’re talking about? You’ll lose it to the market anyway if you go on like this. So, why not invest it in yourself first? You’re the most important asset you have. Don’t forget that.

5. The ultimate goal is to forget how time flows. You should be so immersed in it that you lose track of time. That’s when you know you’re doing it right. That’s when you know you’re doing it for yourself. That way, you can avoid the lure of the market most of the time. Don’t do it to avoid the market. Do it because you love it. Naturally, a day will come when you can say, “Oh, I didn’t notice this or that happened in the market.” You get the idea.

6. Let your loved ones and others know that you are seriously committing to this. It’s a trick that holds you accountable. You wouldn’t want to be seen as a liar, right? You wouldn’t want to be seen as a loser, right? You wouldn’t want to be seen as a quitter, right? You’re better than that. You’re a winner. Let them know you WILL do it, and show them your progress.

You often see me sharing my commitment and progress on social media, whether you notice it or not. For example, my 1000 portrait or lineart projects. You see me doing it, and you know I’ll see it through. I always did and always will. That's the definition of one's commitment and track record. Make a bold statement and achieve it step by step. 1000 portraits? One portrait a day. 1000 days. About two and a half years. So easy. That's the spirit.

Don't mimic what I do. Find your own thing. Actively seek it. Don’t wait for it to come to you; it won’t. You have to find it. Don’t seek advice from others—they won’t know what makes you happy. Avoid the trap of thinking that booze or other vices will bring you happiness.

Don’t try to find something related to investing or your stocks. That’s being stupid. Just don’t. Again, it’s all about your happiness. That happiness will set you free from the chains of the market. You’ll be a better investor, a better person. You’ll be happier. And that’s all that matters.

If you can do it successfully once, you won’t need any more explanation about why you should do it. You’ll just do it.

And then you’ll move on to other things that make you even happier. The virtuous cycle will continue, and your happiness will compound like your returns. Trust me.

Don’t forget: good things take time. Your happiness is worth it. You’re worth it. You’re the most important asset you have. Invest in yourself. You’ll be glad you did.

Oh, you don’t have to thank me later. Thank your loved ones who tolerate your selfishness for a while. They’ll be glad you did when they see your portfolio and happiness grow.

Amusingly enough, they should encourage you to do it more. If they don’t, either you’re doing it wrong, or... there’s no such thing as a perfect family. Let’s face it.
