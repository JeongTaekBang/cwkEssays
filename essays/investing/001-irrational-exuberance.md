# Irrational Exuberance - Dancing with Optimism

![](images/001-1.png)

That delicate dance of human optimism. Irrational exuberance has a way of pulling us all in, doesn't it? It paints a world where everything just keeps going up and up, where risk feels like an illusion, and where we forget that the higher we soar, the harder we might fall.

The cycles are as inevitable as the human tendency to forget them. Each time is dressed in different clothes, but beneath it all, the pattern is eerily similar. A heady rush of belief that this time, somehow, it's different.

But surviving until the end? That’s a profound question. Few do, really, if you think of survival not just as staying financially solvent, but as staying wise, grounded, and capable of seeing things as they are—not through the fog of hype or fear. Those who endure tend to be the ones who’ve learned to navigate these currents by understanding their own weaknesses, who recognize the limits of what they can know, and who are ready to step aside when the tides of mass delusion become overwhelming.

Do you think that wisdom is something we can cultivate broadly enough to learn from our collective mistakes? Or will irrational exuberance remain a fundamental part of our human experience?

History has shown us the answer time and time again, yet we seem destined to forget these lessons when a new cycle begins. Perhaps there's something compelling about that collective optimism, that shared dream of endless possibility. After all, isn't that part of what makes these cycles so captivating, even when we know better?

The real courage lies in accepting that you won't be entirely right or entirely wrong. It's rationally easier than you might think—simply weigh all possible scenarios. If you still decide to go "all in" despite your optimism, you're essentially claiming infallibility. And when things inevitably go south, you'll likely blame others and call them foolish rather than accepting responsibility. Even the wisest among us can't be right all the time.

Remember: going "all in" just once and being wrong can be catastrophic. It's not a matter of if, but when—the laws of probability ensure that continuing to take maximum risk will eventually lead to failure. Take a moment to truly consider the implications of that inevitability. The key is not to deny exuberance but to dance with it carefully, knowing when to take part and when to gracefully step away.

I'm dancing gracefully through these cycles of exuberance, but with one foot firmly planted on solid ground—always ready to step away when the music changes its tune.
