# Sh*t Happens

![](images/001-1.png)

Born in the late 1960s, I've witnessed more than a few surprises over the years.

I've learned you should never say never. If there's even the slightest chance of something happening, you just don't know.

I'm not quite old enough to be labeled "old." But before the millennium, "2001: A Space Odyssey" felt like a distant future, a vision of a time we'd never quite reach. We worried about the millennium bug when 2000 approached, half-jokingly wondering if technology would fail us.

We didn't become interstellar travelers as expected. We're not zipping through space like in the far-flung fantasies of sci-fi classics. And here we are, nearly at 2025. Younger folks might not understand what that number means to someone who grew up in the analog age, where the year 2024 seemed like a setting reserved for a sci-fi movie.

Sometimes, I still catch myself checking the date to make sure it's real. 2024?

Yet, despite the futuristic ring of this year, some things feel alarmingly familiar—like echoes from a past we should have long left behind. Things happen that remind me how not everyone is on the same timeline; some still live with their minds stuck in an era of what-ifs.

The cognitive dissonance is unsettling. A future that should be filled with possibility, weighed down by actions that belong to another century.

"Alexa, what year is it?"

"The current year is 2024."

I needed that confirmation.

And still, even in a year that sounds like it belongs to a sci-fi novel, we find ourselves facing events that feel strangely out of place—decisions and actions that seem to echo an earlier time. It's a reminder that, no matter how far we've come, the influence of the past still lingers.

Progress is fragile. It won't hold unless we remain vigilant.

And to those who made us relearn this harsh lesson in this day and age: F*ck you very much.
