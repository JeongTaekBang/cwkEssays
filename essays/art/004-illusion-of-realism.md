# The Illusion of Realism: Why You Should Embrace Statistics

Here's why you need to have statistics in your skillset.

Many people get confused about what is 'real.' When someone mentions being realistic, you should ask yourself: in terms of what? What is the standard of realism here?

Mostly, they talk in non-analog realms: digital, or misunderstood analog realms.

In the digital realm, nothing is continuous. Everything is discrete, so realism exists in the discrete realm. Capturing analog data into digital loses continuity. Even lossless audio files are lossless only in the digital realm. When you record analog audio, you risk losing continuity due to sampling, which means picking a point in time and recording the value at that point. The more points you pick, the more realistic the audio becomes, but it's still not continuous. It's discrete, skipping infinite points between two points. That's the nature of digital.

Digital photos and videos are the same. They are discrete, not continuous. The more pixels you have, the more realistic the photo becomes, but it's still not continuous. You skip infinite points between two pixels. No matter how high the resolution, if you zoom in enough, you'll see the pixels. In the real world, you can zoom in infinitely and still see continuity. That's the difference between digital and analog.

Then, there are misunderstood analog realms: any realm your brain deals with.

Your brain can't handle an infinite stream of analog data. If it had to, you'd go crazy like the Lord of Frenzied Flame in Elden Ring. Your brain has its own normalization mechanism to handle analog data, sampling the streaming data as needed. It's not like digital sampling; your brain does it naturally, skipping as much as it can while maintaining the integrity of the data. However, untrained brains often fail to maintain this integrity, sampling too much or too little.

Don't think your brain takes in the real world full of analog data as it is. It can't.

That's why we can't draw things like some geniuses. The art of drawing, whether it's a simple sketch, line art, or full color, is the art of sampling. You sample the real world and put it on paper. The more you sample, the more realistic it becomes, but it's still not real. It's just a sample.

No matter how realistic you want your drawing to be, it's still a sample and should be treated as such. You can't draw the real world as you can't record the real world at full fidelity. You can only sample it.

Once you realize this simple statistical truth in life, you'll be free from the burden of realism. If you want to draw well, aim to get better at sampling. Every line you draw is a sample. Every stroke, dot, shade, and color is a sample. You need to pick the most representative sample for the data you're trying to capture with as few samples as possible. That's the art of drawing.

That's why they say you shouldn't draw every detail you see, like hair or skin pores. You should draw the most representative details that make the viewer see the whole picture. You average out the details and draw the most representative ones.

Even a single dot can represent a beautiful or cute nose in anime. That's the power of sampling. However, the surrounding context, like other facial features, should contribute to the overall representation. Only then can the single dot be seen as a nose.

That's the simple insight you get from statistics.

If you still treat statistics as a boring subject, you're missing out on the beauty of life itself. You're missing out on one of the key engines that drive the whole universe.

I beg you to reconsider your stance on statistics. It's not just a subject. It's the essence of life itself. It should be the essence of everything you do in your life.

But again, I know, statistically, most of you won't.
