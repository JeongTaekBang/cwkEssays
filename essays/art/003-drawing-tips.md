# Personal Tips for Fellow Drawing Enthusiasts 

If you enjoy drawing like me, whether digital or traditional, you might want to consider the following tips:

Mind you, I'm still a beginner in the grand scheme of things, but I've learned a few things along the way that might help you on your journey. That's all. I'm not claiming to be an expert or anything. I still struggle with drawing, but I just wanted to help you save some time and frustration.

1. Rules are there to be bent or broken. Don't be afraid to experiment with different styles and techniques. You never know what you might discover. Remember: no hard and fast rules in anything except exact sciences.

2. You're interpreting 3D objects on a 2D surface. It's not easy. It's not supposed to be easy. It's a skill that takes time to develop. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right the first time. Keep practicing.

3. Practice smart. Don't just draw the same thing over and over again without learning anything. Every practice session should have a purpose and a Eureka moment. Be mindful of what you're doing and why you're doing it.

4. Start with basic shapes even when drawing complex objects like human figures. Then sculpt those shapes into the final form with details. If your basic shapes are off, your final drawing will be off as well. Details would just add to its ugliness.

5. Train your eyes. If your drawing from imagination is far inferior to your drawing from reference, that's probably because you are not training your eyes to see the proportions and the placement of facial features correctly. Your practice sessions should be focused on training your eyes and aligning your hand with your eyes. If something looks off, it probably is.

6. Every line and stroke counts, especially for faces. If you're drawing a face, every line and stroke should be deliberate and purposeful. Do not add lines just for the sake of adding lines. Conversely, suggest lines that are not there. Suggested lines can be more powerful than actual lines.

7. Don't shade or color your drawing until you're satisfied with your line art skills. Shading and coloring can hide a multitude of sins. If your line art is weak, your shading and coloring won't save it. Moreover, they require different skills. Without trained eyes, you won't be able to see the volumes and the light sources correctly. It's a waste of time repeating something without understanding it.

8. Focus on your line art skills first. Don't sweat complex stuff if your line drawings aren't strong. Anatomy, perspective, and all that jazz can wait. Focus on your line art skills first. Learn as you go, and don't be a perfectionist beginner.

9. Memorize. Period. Even skilled artists or art teachers seldom tell you this, but you should memorize stuff and their usage. All those lines from different angles have a lot in common. The muscle memory for drawing them comes from memorization. The more you draw them, the more you memorize them. The more you memorize them, the more you can draw them from imagination. 

10. Make the best of AIs. Their immediate feedback can be invaluable. You can't have this luxury with any human teacher. Their feedback is eye-opening and instant. They can point out your mistakes and suggest improvements right away. You might say AIs are not perfect. Sure, but who is? Even Michelangelo had his critics. Just take whatever you can learn from them and move on.

To get AI feedback, run your local installation of Stable Diffusion since it's the only way you have complete control over the process using what is called ControlNet. Midjourney's image weight doesn't provide the same level of control. Alternatively, use other commercial services like Leonardo that are based on Stable Diffusion. They're essentially Stable Diffusion on steroids. Choose your favorite model and provide it with your drawing to get feedback on line art, shading, or even colorization.

Give enough weight to control the output since you're attempting to learn, not to get a finished product. I'd suggest 70% control weight, which translates to 0.7 in decimal. Learn Stable Diffusion and its ControlNet feature to get the most out of it. Your skills will improve dramatically.

11. Write your own journal detailing your own drawing methods. Don't just rely on others' methods like Loomis heads or Bridgman anatomy. They're great, but they're not you. At the end of the day, you want your own style and methods that you can explain to yourself and others. You need to develop your own unique style and step-by-step drawing methods.

12. Good things take time. Don't rush. Don't be discouraged. Don't compare yourself to others. You're on your own journey. You're not competing with anyone. You're just trying to be better than you were yesterday.

Isn't it amusing? It's just a polymorphic way of basic learning methods you're always familiar with. From the object-oriented mindset, just inherit the basic learning method and override some details to fit the drawing: polymorphism and encapsulation. The object-orientation is essential in learning or honing any skill.
