A collection of essays that will form a free online book, covering various topics including artificial intelligence, investing, life experiences, art, entertainment, and more. Some essays are written in Korean, my native language, to preserve nuanced expression of certain ideas.

한국어는 '대두족장' 캐릭터의 말투로 쓰여진 경우가 많으니 오해 없으시기 바랍니다.

## Who is C.W.K.?

C.W.K. stands for Creative Works of Knowledge (Korean: 최완규), a tech enthusiast with over three decades of experience across various fields. Known as '대두족장' in Korean communities, I combine technical expertise with creative storytelling to share insights about technology, investing, and life.

I'm the author of several free online books in both Korean and English, including comprehensive guides on PyTorch, MLX, and AI Mathematics. These works are freely available at:

🌐 Quick Access Domains:

- https://creativeworksofknowledge.net - Essay Collection

My essays reflect a broad range of interests and experiences, from artificial intelligence to investment strategies, art, and gaming. While the topics vary, they share a common goal: to provide valuable insights while encouraging open discussion and diverse perspectives. 

While I aim to be respectful, I maintain my own perspective and writing style. I prefer sharing insights over engaging in debates. 

## AI Collaboration Statement

In the spirit of full transparency, I openly collaborate with various AI technologies in my writing and research process. This collaboration enhances my work while maintaining my authentic voice and original ideas. Here's how AI fits into my workflow:

### AI Language Models

I regularly work with advanced language models including:

- 🤖 OpenAI's GPT-4o and its variants
- 🤖 Anthropic's Claude
- 🤖 Other state-of-the-art models as they become available

### AI-Assisted Tools

My writing process is helped by:

- 💻 Cursor IDE for enhanced writing and coding
- 🎨 Various image generation models for visual content
- 🧮 PyTorch, MLX and other ML frameworks when needed

While these AI tools assist with research, refinement, and technical implementation, all ideas, perspectives, and creative direction remain entirely my own. Think of these AI systems as sophisticated writing and research assistants - they help organize and refine my thoughts, but the core insights and narratives are mine.

This transparency about AI collaboration reflects my commitment to honest communication with readers. It's part of my broader philosophy that technology should enhance, not replace, human creativity and insight.

## Project Status

Consider this repository an "early access" version of a free online book. These essays, originally posted on X.com, are being collected, refined, and reorganized here. As with any early access content:

- 📝 New essays are regularly added from X.com
- 🔄 Existing content may be significantly revised 
- 🏗️ Structure and organization will evolve
- 🔗 Some links may break during reorganization

While you're welcome to read and reference this early version, please note its dynamic nature. Think of it as watching a free online book take shape, with all the ongoing refinements that entails.

## Repository Philosophy

This repository is public but read-only, not out of fear of plagiarism, but to prevent misunderstandings and maintain the integrity of the content. Many essays discuss complex topics where context and nuance are crucial. By keeping the repository read-only, we ensure that:

1. Ideas are presented as intended, with proper context
2. Discussions happen in appropriate channels rather than through fragmented copies
3. Readers engage with the complete perspective rather than isolated excerpts
4. Updates and corrections come from a single, authoritative source

The goal is to share knowledge effectively while avoiding the spread of misinterpretations or oversimplified versions of nuanced topics.

## 저장소 운영 철학

공개 저장소지만 읽기 전용으로 설정돼 있습니다. 표절이나 무단 복제를 우려해서가 아니라 맥락과 뉘앙스가 중요한 복잡한 주제를 다루는 글들이 잘못 이해되거나 왜곡되거나 와전되는 것을 방지하고, 본래 의도와 내용의 완전성을 유지하기 위한 겁다. 읽기 전으로 설정된 이유를 요약하면 다음과 같습니다:

1. 의도한 맥락 그대로 아이디어 전달 - 왜곡된 문맥으로 전달되는 사태를 최대한 방지
2. 문맥이 틀어진 파편화된 복사본이 아닌 통일된 채널을 통한 온전한 내용 전달
3. 부분적 발췌가 아닌 전체적 관점에서의 이해 도모
4. 단일 출처를 통한 업데이트와 수정 일원화

이 방식을 통해 복잡한 주제들 과도하게 단순화되거나 잘못 해석되어 퍼지는 것을 방지하고, 지식을 효과적으로 공유하는 것이 이 저장소의 궁극적인 목표이니 양해바랍니다. 간단히, 불펌 및 무단 복제를 막기 위한 것이라기 보다 오해와 왜곡으로부터 여러분을 보호하려는 의도랍니다.

또 '대두족장'이라는 캐릭터에 어울리는 한국어 표현과 문체가 사용되는 경우가 많으니 역시 오해 없으시기 바랍니다. 캐릭터와 실제 사람을 혼동하지 말라는 뜻입니다. 배우가 악역을 한다고 해서 진짜 악당이 아니듯이 말입니다. 근까... 대두족장은 걍 연기라고 연기. 오케?🤗
